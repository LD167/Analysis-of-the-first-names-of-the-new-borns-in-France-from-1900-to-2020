Understand the ethnic, confessional and cultural evolution of the french population over the past century through the analysis of the first names given to the newborns in France from 1900 to 2020.
# 1/ DATA EXPLORATION WITH SQL

# 2/ WEB SCRAPING WITH PYTHON
Retrieve with BeautifoulSoup all the first names lists per ethnic origins (or based on other categories) hosted in several web sites.
A first step has been achieved retrieving the first names lists per ethnic origins hosted in the web site EMMA.COM
Other steps are pending.
# 3/ DATA CLEANING AND STRUCTURATION WITH EXCEL / PYTHON
Clean and combine the data from INSEE and from EMMA.COM in order to classify the first names of the new borns per ethnocultural types and other relevant categories.
A first step has been achieved using Excel.
A second step is pending using Python in order to push further and deeper the cleaning and the classification. 
# 4/ DATA VISUALISATION WITH TABLEAU
Run the processed data with Tableau Public in order to visualise the evolution of the french first names by ethnocultural types and other relevant categories from 1900 to 2020.
A first step has been achieved running the data already processed.
Other steps are pending.
